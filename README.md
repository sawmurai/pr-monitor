# What is this?

This is a little node script to list all opened pull requests you are involved with, along with it's build status
and some meta information (head-branch, base-branch and link to the actual pull request). The script can help
you keep an overview over all the different builds you are waiting for if your CI is slow :)

# Installation

1. Install

```bash
npm install
```

2. Add API KEY and LOGIN to `.env.dist` and rename to `.env`

# Usage

```bash
node index.js.
```
